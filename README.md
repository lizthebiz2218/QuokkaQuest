# QuokkaQuest
You are to create a simple game where your player wanders through a maze or a map.
• They must avoid some obstacles,
• There must be a health and scoring system
• There must be a way out of the maze/map
• You can incorporate some sort of combat
• You must use your own custom art!
• See if you can implement a menu and custom graphics
