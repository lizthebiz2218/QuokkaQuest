You are to create a simple game where your player wanders through a maze or a map. <br />
• They must avoid some obstacles, <br />
• There must be a health and scoring system <br />
• There must be a way out of the maze/map <br />
• You can incorporate some sort of combat <br />
• You must use your own custom art! <br />
• See if you can implement a menu and custom graphics <br />
